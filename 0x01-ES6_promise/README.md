feat: complete project on JavaScript Promises and async/await

- Implemented a thorough understanding of JavaScript Promises:
  - Explained what Promises are, how they work, and why they are used.
  - Demonstrated how to create and use Promises with the `then`, `resolve`, and `catch` methods.
  - Covered every method of the Promise object including `all`, `race`, `allSettled`, and `any`.
- Illustrated error handling in JavaScript using `throw` and `try...catch` blocks.
- Detailed the use of the `await` operator to handle Promises in an asynchronous function.
- Showcased how to define and use `async` functions for cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.
- Added relevant code examples and explanations to ensure clarity and understanding.
