# Node.js Testing Project with Mocha, Chai, and Sinon

## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate how to write effective tests in Node.js using **Mocha**, **Chai**, and **Sinon**. By the end of this project, you will be able to:

1. Write test suites using **Mocha**.
2. Use different assertion libraries like **Node's `assert`** or **Chai**.
3. Organize and present long test suites.
4. Use **spies** and **stubs** with **Sinon** to mock functions.
5. Understand **hooks** (setup and teardown functions) in test suites.
6. Test asynchronous functions.
7. Write integration tests for a small Node.js server.
